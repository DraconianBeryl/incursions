### 5 Golden Rules of Game Cards Graphic Design you MUST OBEY

Source: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDd4u2xnRtE)

1. Never obscure vital elements - consider how cards will be held, placed, and/or stacked.
2. Follow Visual Hierarchy - The most important information on the card should have the best location and the most space. It's OK to have minor or rarely used information on the card so long as it is unobtrusive.
3. If it can be said in fewer words, say it in fewer words.
4. If it's said repeatedly, say it in symbols.
5. Art is paramount. Art is the glue that holds all of the other elements together and reinforces the theme of the card.

Honorable mention silver rules

1. Color blind friendly palette
2. Clean background
3. Readable text (size, spacing)
4. Keep the rules on the cards, not in the rulebook

### Every bad board game designer does this

1. Work on the project before you've figured out what the vision of the game is (lack of clear vision). To counter:
   a. Define the gheme & concept
   b. create a GDD
2. Think about the play from a player's perspective - even a false impression of imbalance can ruin the fun
3. Overcomplicated rules.
4. Lack of market research - undifferentiated product
5. Not playtesting enough.

1. Get inspired
   a. play games
2. Dream
   a. brainstorm
3. Validate your Ideas - prototyping in the small, individual mechanics in isolation
4. Plan everything
   a. Key mechanics
   b. components
   c. key pillars of gameplay
   d. scope and potential cost of the game
   e. market research
5. Prototype - MVP
6. Playtesting - do it early, do it often
7. Blance & Refine, iterate and improve - then GOTO step 4
8. Playtest some more - when you finally feel that there's nothing missing and nothing left to take away
   a. you're looking for reasons to go back to step 4
   b. you think all that's left to do is balancing the numbers for the systems rather than changing how the mechanics work
   c. written rules, but not a finished rulebook
9. Art & Design
   a. this will make a good design come to life
10. Finalize & Produce
    a. Finishing is important - this is why we have second editions
