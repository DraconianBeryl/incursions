### How To Play

#### Choose a Scenario

The scenario will determine the overall structure of the game, with each
scenario providing its own setup instructions.

##### Scenarios
* Random Three-Phase Investigation

#### Follow Scenario Setup

The Scenario Sheet has the final say on the setup procedures.  What
follows here is the general flow for most Scenarios.

##### General Setup Flow

This structure is used for all phases of the game for most scenarios.

It is recommended that one player take the lead for following the
Scenario Sheet and that the other players assist under their direction.
Some setup actions, such as selecting clues according to the Scenario
Sheet, can greatly benefit from having multiple players participate in
the creation and shuffling of the setup decks.

###### Select Locations
1. Add all locations marked as Mandatory on the Scenario Sheet to the
   Play Area.
2. Gather additional locations into a deck using the breakdown on the
   Scenario Sheet, e.g. Gather all Capitol Locations.
3. Shuffle the deck and add cards to the Play Area as directed by the
   Scenario Sheet.
4. Return all unused location cards to the box.
5. Give locations Clue Markers as directed by the Scenario Sheet.  a.
   Some locations may not be assigned a Clue Marker.  These locations
   will not have any clue encounters for moving the investigation
   forward, though they will usually have other reasons to visit them.

###### Create the Clue Deck and Distribute Clues

1. Take the Clue Location Cards corresponding to the symbols assigned to
   locations.
2. Shuffle the Clue Location Cards and set aside several of them, as
   specified on the Scenario Sheet, in a face-down pile without looking
   at them forming the Leads Deck.
3. Select Clues according to the Scenario Sheet.
   1. The number of clues selected should match the number of Location
      Cards that were set aside previously.
   2. Each clue will usually be drawn from a different clue category,
      e.g. Region, Cult, Goal, Method, and Motive.
   3. Take cards from each clue category deck as specified on the
      Scenario Sheet, e.g. Select only Primal Elemental Cults.
   4. Shuffle the selected cards and deal one face-down next to each
      Location marked with a Clue Marker.
   5. Return all unused clue category cards to the box without looking
      at them.
4. Shuffle the deck formed by combining the remaining locations with the
   clue cards and deal one face-down to each location with an assigned
   symbol.
5. (each location will have its own instructions for how to search for
   clues)

###### ~~Fill out the Location Decks~~

1. ~~Find the Encounter Deck corresponding to the Locale specified on
   the Scenario Sheet.  Most three-phase investigations will start in
   the Capital Locale.~~
2. ~~Each Location, both those with a symbol and those without, will
   specify a number of cards from a number of Encounter Decks, including
   the current Locale Deck.  For example a location may specify to use 5
   General Store, 2 Locale, and 2 Shopkeeper Encounters.~~
3. ~~Shuffle each Encounter Category deck~~
4. ~~Deal the specified number of cards face-down to each location from
   the corresponding Encounter Category decks.~~
5. ~~Return the remaining Encounter Category cards to the box without
   looking at them.~~

#### Begin Play

### Rules Reference

#### Components

##### Flavored dice

All sets of dice have warp/ward. Each PC has a designated "native"
flavor of magic and the rules state that warp/ward results are ignored
on all dice of that designated "native" flavor.

1. one or more sets of colored dice for all magic types, have the warp
   and ward symbols as described elsewhere.

Benefit - only one template needed for all dice.

Detriment - one color of dice must be canonically associated with the
"native" magic of the world. There are multiple viable options for this,
but there are also several options that SHOULD be avoided.

Detriment - this pretty much requires that the physical game ship with
one set of dice for each flavor of magic, of which there have been
planned to be many, or else it requires some other manual bookkeeping by
the players the same as the "unflavored dice" option.

##### Unflavored dice

One set of dice has all of the symbols described elsewhere - the grades
of success, warp, and ward.  Another set of dice only has the grades of
success.

1. a set of dice for "native" and non- magic, have only the symbols for
   successes.
2. one or more sets of dice for "alien" magic, have the warp and ward
   symbols as described elsewhere.

Benefit - makes the results less cluttered and potentially notably
easier to read.

Benefit - possibly the lowest cost alternative, even with the need for
two dice templates, because the game only needs two sets of dice (with
some aid for any cases when multiple flavors of alien magic are
involved).

Detriment - the most benefit is seen when all of the dice are the same
color, which means that the game ought to provide some assistance to the
players to track things when a roll involves multiple flavors of alien
magic.

## Locations

* Global investigationg game phase
  * The Capital (The City)
    * The capital offers reliable access to standard services and has
      the lowest travel costs, but the selection in shops is somewhat
      limited because of the increased patrolling from the Suppression
      Bureau.
    * Black market outlets may exist, though they will be wary because
      the players are working for the Suppression Bureau, but there is
      somewhat of an understanding where careful proprietors can
      unofficially be afforded some lenience providing they are careful
      and respectful.
    * Perhaps there's also a licensing/ranking system, kind of like
      FFLs, so that there can be authorized dealers for higher-tier
      merch.
    * Mostly modern.
    * Embassies of foreign countries
    * The Capital is also a busy port, with lots of trade and travelers

# Game

## Chrome - shiny bits that aren't strictly necessary

* Guided setup/play/teardown app.  On-screen prompts and optional spoken
  prompts.  MUST be able to handle all standard scenarios as well as
  ++conforming++ fan scenarios.
  * Maybe also guided unboxing?
* Include tuckboxes for all decks, or at least punchouts to make them
  * Expansions also contain the same, but in two sizes
    * Base + this one expansion
    * Base + this expansion + all prior expansions

## Mechanics

* Clue trail:
  * Create a random directed acyclic graph
    * Blind selection of random set of destinations (number can be used
      to tweak game length)
    * Association of each destination with an identifying symbol
    * Take the "clue trail" cards with the matching symbols, choose a
      suit for each separate clue trail
    * Shuffle the selected suit and set of clue trail cards and replace
      a random one with the objective card, setting the removed card
      aside for later
    * Shuffle the clue trail cards and include a random one in each
      location deck
    * Reveal the clue trail card that was replaced by the objective
      card.  This is where the trail starts.  In the deck for that
      location there will either be the objective card or a clue trail
      card pointing to another location.  That location will itself
      either have the objective card or a clue trail card pointing
      elsewhere.  There may be isolated cyclical graphs of clue trail
      cards, but the trail starting from the initially-revealed clue
      trail card is guaranteed to lead to the objective.
  * A single multi-step clue trail can be created
    * Use a goal card for each desired step, each of them replacing a
      single destination.
    * Reveal the top card of the stack of removed destinations.  This is
      the start of the clue trail.
    * After a goal card is found, the next card on the stack of removed
      destinations is revealed to show where the next step of the clue
      trail starts.
    * Continue in this manner until the final goal is found.
    * Fun fact: with 8 destinations a 2-step clue trail has an average
      length of exactly 6
  * Maths:
    * A single-goal clue trail has average length (N+1)/2, where N is
      the number of destinations
    * A two-goal clue trail has length
      * 18/3 with 8 destination
      * 16/3 with 7 destinations
      * 14/3 with 6 destinations
    * Generalizes to:
      * With N as the number of destinations
      * With G as the number of goals
      * Given that N >= G
      * G(N+1)/(G+1)
  * (this will happen most often when using multiple clue trails) if a
    clue trail card is encountered out of order
    * optionally make a check and on failure (or declined check) set the
      clue trail face-up beside the location deck and draw a new card
    * On success the clue trail card is encountered as-if the
      prerequisite was met.
    * Passing a check like this is the only way to break into an
      isolated cyclical graph of clue trail cards, though doing so is a
      waste of time and thus can be considered to be chasing a
      red-herring.
    * There is only one opportunity to encounter the card
      out-of-sequence.
    * Any set-aside clue trail card may be encountered by choice by
      anyone at that location once its prerequisite is met.
  * Variants
    * More than one starting clue revealed
    * Parallel clue trails, each set up independently in the same
      locations using something, e.g. color, to distinguish them.
* Dual-purpose power/corruption dice for attributes - using dice builder
  (ish) mechanics for character attributes
  * Three categories of symbols on the dice
    * Power - lesser, normal, and greater - count as successes
    * Warp - generates unintended consequences
    * Ward - cancels out Warp
  * All dice rolled for checks serve the purposes of:
    * Determining how powerful the result is, which may determine
      success or failure
    * Determining if there are any unintended consequences, which may
      lead to corruption
    * Determining if there are any negative consequences from merely
      encountering a monster - I can't recall the exact mechanics I
      envisioned for this, but the idea is to be similar to AH's
      one-time(ish) horror check.
  * Flavor-wise in this setting:
    * Using your native magic type is always safe from Warp
    * The native magic type of the primary world is plentiful, but with
      relatively modest maximum power.
    * While you could run your forge or airship on elemental fire magic,
      it would be like using an unshielded fission reactor to do the job
    * In warfare the safest you could make using massive non-native
      magic would be somewhat like a "dirty bomb", except that you have
      to send an expert physicist in to set it off, and until those
      exposed succumb (which could take weeks or months) they may now be
      able to throw fireballs or other unpleasant things your way.
    * It's possible to tap into the life force of a living being to
      sustain a ward that contains their corruption so that, for the
      most part, it doesn't get worse or contaminate others, but this is
      limited to generating only a small amount of Ward.
      * Mechanically this means giving characters one ward for each die
        of a non-native magic type that they started the game with in
        one of their attribute pools.
  * Each character has a native "flavor" of magic.
    * All Warp and Ward symbols are ignored on dice of the character's
      native magic type, unless an effect explicitly mentions counting
      such symbols on native magic dice..
  * Various sources may add dice to the pool rolled by a character.
    * If using a source of dice, whether voluntarily or otherwise, it is
      mandatory to use all of the specified dice
    * If the character has optional rerolls available, they are always
      optional.  Mandatory rerolls are always mandatory.
    * If any mechanic specifies that certain results add additional dice
      to the roll, adding and rolling these dice is not optional unless
      explicitly specified to be
  * Various sources may add or remove Ward and/or Warp results to the
    result of a roll.  These results may be either typed or untyped.
  * Untyped Ward can be used for any flavor of Warp
  * Untyped Warp can be offset by any flavor of Ward
  * Various sources may grant the ability to treat additional flavors as
    native
  * Unintended Consequences takes the form of a deck, each with multiple
    effects based on the quantity of Warp. Examples include:
    * permanently modifying a character by adding a die of a non-native
      flavor to their pool for an attribute.  This effect may also
      remove a native die from the same pool.  This will put the
      character at risk of unintended consequences every time they use
      that attribute.  They may be of the form "if you currently have
      less than n dice of this flavor in your attribute pool, add one
      die of this flavor to your attribute pool"
    * "Exploding" GP results - roll an additional die for each GP
      result, adding successes to the test result, but with the type of
      the Unintended Consequence. Additional Warp results trigger
      additional Unintended Consequences (counting all Warp, or only the
      new?)
  * Each character starts the game with (at least) one die of a
    non-native flavor in one of their attribute pools.  It is not yet
    decided if this is determined by character, player choice, random,
    scenario, or maybe some of each.
    * E.g. one character might let the player choose, but constrained to
      Seelie or Unseelie
    * Character-specific constraints have highest priority, but as long
      as those aren't violated then any other constraints will apply.
    * Maybe the characters are all "damaged goods", which is why they've
      been "chosen" for this line of work.
      * "You are going to die, and horribly, but at least you have the
        option to do so heroically"
  * Each flavor of magic has its own deck of unintended consequences.
  * It may be that each consequence card has a priority number on it,
    with lower numbers being associated with milder results.  Some
    effects (or quantities of uncontrolled power) may give the character
    "advantage" or "disadvantage" on their draw.  Some effects may give
    the player direct choice between drawn cards.
  * ~~"Blessed" and "Cursed" status may be either type or untyped.
    Untyped applies to all flavors of dice.~~
    * ~~Note that being "blessed" when using non-native dice increases
      the risk of unintended consequences~~
    * ~~[The blessed/cursed status here was envisioned as improving the
      number of sides on the dice, e.g. going from d6 to d8, where one
      of the new sides is a NP and the other is a P (using the symbology
      below)]~~
  * Possible die symbols
    * P - Warp
    * D - Ward
    * LP - Lesser Power - only provides power when "blessed"
    * NP - Power when not "cursed" (i.e. normal)
    * GP - Greater power (i.e. even when "cursed")
  * Distribution of symbols
    * Possible Distribution A:
      * d6 - P x 2, D x 1, LP x 1, NP x 1, GP x 1
    * Notes for distribution A:
      * 1/3 Chance of P
      * 1/6 Chance of D
      * 1/6 Chance of GP
      * 1/3 Chance of (GP | NP)
      * 1/2 Chance of (GP | NP | LP)
      * D6-only method (AH-style success rules):
        * 1,2 = P
        * 3 = D
        * 4 = LP
        * 5 = NP
        * 6 = GP
      * Rolling 4 non-native dice (any size) with +2 Ward, and neither
        blessed nor cursed, always gives EV(Ward) = 2 * EV(Warp)
    * ~~Distributions with multiple symbols on some faces could also
      exist, though likely with very different target numbers.~~
  * Process of making a skill test:
    * 1. The test isn't over until the player has no remaining unrolled
      **mandatory** dice and either no way to modify the results or
      chooses to not modify the results further.
    * 2. Any unrolled **mandatory** dice MUST be rolled. All of these
      dice are rolled as one group.
    * 3. Any unrolled **optional** dice MAY be rolled along with the
      **mandatory** dice as one group.
    * 4. Usually all of the dice from a source must be added, or not, as
      a group. If a source of dice allows for partial use it will
      describe how and when it may be done.
    * 5. Each time a group of dice is rolled for the test there are
      Unintended Consequences if there is new unmitigated Warp. If there
      are multiple flavors of Warp they are handled independently.
    * 6. The Unintended Consequences results always depend on the total
      amount of that flavor of unmitigated Warp in the test results and
      not just the amount of new unmitigated Warp.
    * 7. The results of the Unintended Consequences (if any) must be
      applied completely before the number of successes is evaluated or
      reevaluated.
    * Example: if a player has five "add a die to a test" markers (in
      the style of AH2 clue tokens) they may choose to add these
      one-by-one, and reassess the test results after each one, or they
      may choose to add them all at once and reassess the test results
      only once. If the dice added by these markers may add unmitigated
      Warp to the result then using these tokens one at a time risks up
      to five additional Unintended Consequences (of increasing
      severity) while adding them all at once risks only one additional
      Unintended Consequences (though possibly at the highest level of
      severity).
* Narrowing of Scope
  * Game is played in phases, each with a smaller physical scope and
    correspondingly shorter timescale
  * Each phase is on a different map
  * The timing of characters and plot events in one phase is based on
    the timing of the character's arrival at the location in the prior
    phase and the progression of the plot from the earlier phase.
  * There might be scenarios where if the investigators do poorly they
    have to pop up a scope, race to a new location, and then quickly
    narrow the scope again.
  * If the narrowest scope gets down to Mansions of Madness level of
    detail, there might be some scenarios with special encounters that
    jump immediately to this narrowest scope and then return.
    * These special encounters will require all players to be present to
      be activated?
  * Monsters:
    * At the widest scope, monsters roaming the map should be rare, and
      possibly limited only to unique monsters
      * This isn't a limit on monsters in encounters
    * At the narrowest scope, monsters should be abundant
    * Generally, the narrower the scope the more plentiful the monsters
* Procedural generation w/o a computer
  * This doesn't need to be a board - it can be an arrangement of
    location cards/decks like PACG is.
  * In MoM, many tiles only contain one or two spaces, so it really
    doesn't have a tremendously complicated graph either
  * Regarding locations, location composition, and clue trails...
    * Maybe instead of pre-building a deck for a location, the location
      has a table of encounter types, and you roll for it each time
      * Could roll 2d6 for 2-12 bell distribution
      * Could roll Nd{Power} and count power symbols - this will also be
        somewhat bell-like
      * Could make a test on a particular attribute that's thematic to
        the location - in this case the decks indicated by better
        results should give better rewards
      * Gates could be handled as additional locations, possibly linked
        only to a single other location
    * Many encounters could end with "You may reveal the topmost
      unrevealed card in this location's clue stack"
  * Maybe use tiles similar to the Magic Realm hexes?
    * Could maybe even use the double-sided mechanic where MR's
      "enchanted" becomes "corrupted"?
    * MR hexes are "too busy" with 6 locations per hex
    * Smaller hexes, with only one space each, would probably be better
    * Have categories of hexes, e.g. town, open country, cave, etc.
    * each category of hex has a randomizer deck
    * have a deck of layouts that specify what type of hex to put where
    * layout also specifies order to build the map
    * hex card has information to know if that hex can fit in the space
      without digging for the hex
    * maybe each type of hex has subsets based on general map area (e.g.
      outer edge vs border vs inner) and the randomizer cards have an
      entry for each subset
    * would definitely want something to keep the hexes aligned - a
      frame, guide, or intersection pieces, or something
      * we're into custom component land, but several strips that go
        from one side of the board to the other and have a ridge along
        the seam between tiles
    * maybe the tile board is an expansion
    * could have "map packs" that primarily expand the variety of
      layouts, locations, and encounters
    * could have a printed board for the EH-scope play, then build the
      regional (AH) scope on top of it, and then the "intimate" (MoM)
      scope on top of that
  * Eldritch Horror has, by far, the most complex map graph of all the
    AH series games
* Campaign flow management and location unlocks from Gloomhaven

## Setting

* Parallel Earth, but with native Magic that is plentiful though not
  tremendously powerful.
* Other dimensions want to invade, but it requires the work of mortals
  in this world to open a substantial portal to allow a powerful entity
  to cross.
* Cults fascinated by these alien beings have always been around, but
  knowledge of them is suppressed to reduce the risk of copycats.  It
  may be "security by obscurity", but when dabbling in these arts is
  somewhat equivalent to spinning up an unshielded fission reactor, the
  benefits are worth it.
* The world is starting into a magical "industrial revolution" and the
  related increased availability of magical "utilities" has made it
  easier for these cults to do their work, which has made it harder to
  keep them under control.
* It used to be that these situations were handled by elite forces, with
  a lot of protective warding, the best equipment available, and any
  other support that they needed.
* It also used to be standard practice to execute anyone tainted by
  alien magic as a mercy killing.
* With the increase in cases, they've had to make some adjustments, and
  enough time has passed that things are very different.
* In order to augment the manpower they now conscript anyone tainted by
  alien magic, so long as they weren't an active participant (those are
  still supposed to be executed)
* Initially the old-guard elites had to scale back their operations in
  order to train the mass of new recruits, and then they never went back
  into the field.  The old-guard have morphed into desk jockeys, often
  exemplifying the worst of corrupt middle-management.
* Now all field agents are tainted.  They're also poorly funded,
  ill-equipped, and under-trained.  There is no promotion path that
  leads out of field work.  There is no retirement plan.  The agents
  have no official power or protection (though if jailed in the line of
  duty they will almost always eventually get transferred to a "special
  facility", reprimanded, and then sent back out on field work).  They
  are considered to be disposable assets, and are treated as such
  (though it's rarely admitted openly).  These are the player characters
  of the game.
* Possible "flavors" and their dimensions
  * (all of them trending towards their darker or grimmer
    representations - none of them altruistic, seeing us as useful tools
    at best, but more often simply as food)
  * (want to avoid angelic/demonic)
  * Normal
    * Home
    * Elsewhere - another earthlike world with native magic that is
      effectively interchangable with the native magic of the primary
      world - represented by the same, or substantially similar, art
      style
    * Elsewhen - the primary world at another point in history -
      represented by the same, or substantially similar, art style
    * Dreams?
  * Unseelie
    * Winter Fairy
  * Seelie
    * Summer Fairy
  * Shadow
    * Shadow
  * Mirror?
    * Mirror - or maybe this is Normal flavor
  * Death
    * Underworld (think greek)
  * Each of the 4 classical elements
    * Element-aspected dimensions - not as extreme as D&D
    * (for earth, dwarves and living stone statuary are both good
      candidates as denizens)
  * Vermin (covers all invertebrates?)
    * I don't know what to call it but I can see it
  * Reptilian (includes "dragon-like" things)
  * Mycanoid (also covering Ooze, Rot, and Decay)
  * Clockwork
    * Somewhat steampunk, but maybe also some of the darker things from
      Oz (e.g. wheelers) - man/machine hybrids
  * Avian?
  * Icthyian / deep sea ?
    * It's beginning to look a lot like fish-men...
  * Chthonic? (or would this be Earth?)
  * Cephalopod (distinct from deep sea?)
  * Sorcery?
    * beings of pure energy?
  * Magical Constructs
    * Think Tron
  * Library / Knowledge
    * Not quite TES Apocrypha, and not quite the original infinite
      library, but something similar to both
  * Scrying
    * (eyeball aspected)
  * Metal
    * Disquieting faceless metal beings that may temporarily look
      humanoid
  * Plant (green man)bv
  * Shape Changing
  * Illusion / Masks / False faces
  * Aether?
  * Electricity?
  * Teleportation

# Earliest Thoughts (covering all aspects of the game)

At BGG 2022, a comment was made to me about a wish for a game that
blended the scales of Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness.  This is a
further developing of that idea.

* A thematic game with emergent narrative told collaboratively between
  the players, the cards, and the dice.
* An investigation into things mostly unknown, starting with a wide
  scope and narrowing over the progression of the game.  Arkham Horror +
  Mansions of Madness was the start, but adding Eldritch Horror is a
  natural progression, and given the right setting there could be room
  for an even larger scope at interstellar scale.
* Part of the texture of Arkham Horror is the mostly-ordinary
  investigators going up against foes who are more advanced in both
  science and magic.  Investigators who don't have a clue how deep the
  rabbit-hole goes, but with a personal reason to find out, and only
  taking the role of would-be saviors/protectors of the world because
  there is no one else.
* But straight Cthulhu Mythos has a lot of market saturation now - some
  darker and some campier.  Perhaps a new twist is due?  Or several?
* A magic-based spacefaring society, post-colonial, such that there's
  commercial travel between the stars, and it's mostly reliable.
* Restricting the known sentiants to humans (at least for the most part)
  seems to be necessary to preserve the otherness of things that aren't
  - and the wariness of subversive hybrids.
* In this society, science will be mostly unknown, so some things that
  we think mundane would be strange to them.
* One of the possibilities with magic is that there are so many flavors,
  so it could be that the society uses types that are relatively
  reliable and safe, but there can be many other profane magics out
  there that operate on different rules, demand different prices, and
  have their own dark sponsors.
* Another aspect of the larger mythos is that there are still unexplored
  and uncivilized places where these things hide, and sometimes a veneer
  of civilization has formed near or over one of those hot spots.
* The Laundry Files brings in some other interesting (and strange?)
  angles.
* The idea for the general flow of a game is:
  * hints of trouble in civilization, and a search for clues as to its
    origin, leading eventually to a single planet
  * but where on the planet?  the investigators chase clues, and are
    chased by things, around the globe until they learn which (small)
    region to look into more deeply (Eldritch Horror analogue, but
    shorter)
  * Once in the region, the investigators need to establish and work
    with locals to find the heart of the trouble (Arkham Horror
    analogue, but shorter)
  * Finally, the investigators infiltrate the opposing sanctum to
    accomplish whatevver they need to do.  There should still be some
    unknowns to figure out, and they should always be outnumbered and
    outgunned - this can't be allowed to turn into a dungeon crawl.
* Another mythos aspect to preserve is the dangers of knowledge, and
  especially the power that it can bring, especially to those who aren't
  dedicated to its source.  I would like this to be mechanically
  reinforced as much as possible.
  * One idea for this is that the profane magics always build on the
    power that the individual has with the safer magics, and in a way
    that remains equally tempting for those who have much power as it is
    for those who have little to begin with.  But while it automatically
    adds to power, it doesn't add to control.
  * So, e.g., Lore controls magical power (dice rolled), and using
    Profane Magic X gives a +50% bonus (rounded up, minimum 2) to the
    number of dice rolled, but these additional dice donn't have the
    same distribution of "effect", "side-effect" and "control" symbols,
    where "control" symbols can cancel out "side-effect" symbols and are
    used to harness "effect"symbols and (mildly) bad things happen when
    there aren't enough "control" symbols to go around.
  * dedicated practitioners of these magics have other means at their
    disposal to either maintain control, mitigate the side-effects,
    and/or handle excess effect
  * some of these means may be made available to some of the
    investigators, though with prices that are both subtle and dangerous
  * e.g., suppose that each character has a pool of dedicated dice for
    working magic, and when they roll they have to roll their entire
    pool, and one side-effect of something is that it permanently adds
    (until removed by another effect) a profane power die into their
    pool.
  * perhaps similar things happen with other skills - such that almost
    everything is double-edged.  e.g. this gives bonus strength dice,
    but they're aspected and every once in a while a payment will come
    due
* this could also be a legacy game, maybe even using an analogy of a TV
  show - each game is an "episode", expansions are "seasons", and
  there's the series - each with their own arcs
  * Legacy play should be "light", in that nothing is permanently
    destroyed or marked, but there's a strong mechanism for preserving
    the past
  * e.g. stand-alone player kits that provide individual dice and a
    container to store them in for the stat pools
  * also provide a means for one-off unrelated sessions?
* I would love for this to have a method for procedurally generating
  individual scenarios, planets, regions, and sanctums
  * I would also love to be able to have this work w/o a companion app,
    but a companion app is definitely an option
  * maybe have a "seed" for each legacy group
  * various ideas
    * terrain strips for planets, designed with clear rules for what can
      be adjacent so that the result is guaranteed to work
    * layers of transparency overlays
    * modular tiles, with rules
  * needs to be low on "fiddly factor" for setup
  * needs to be stable during play
* if going with a "laundry files" context, consider making it in the
  very early days of the organization - they don't have a strong
  position within government (assuming they're even part of government),
  barely or begrudgingly funded, very slim on both HUMINT and SIGINT,
  and while the higher ups may have a good understanding of the shape
  and scope of the threat they know very little about any particulars.
  they're also very, very, short on highly qualified field agents.
* the characters start out as fairly ordinary people - accountants,
  archivists, craftsmen, tradesman, merchants, etc (see the professions
  of the AH investigators), but are exposed, or somehow develop,
  something that brings them to the attention of "the laundry" and seals
  them to the organization.  this event also enabled/predisposes them to
  being able to use the profane magics so that they have to walk the
  tighrope for their entire career.
