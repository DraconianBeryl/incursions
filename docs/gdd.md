## Overview

### Vision

A cooperative narrative-focused board game of investigation and horror with a sliding scope and mechanics that can go from global all the way down to a single hideout.

### Target Characteristics

1. Mechanical tension through competing pressures
   1. Gentle, but firm, time pressure to finish the investigation before "bad things" happen
   2. The need to improve character capabilities to be effective in preventing the "bad things".
   3. Growing risk to characters as the scope narrows and as individual capabilities grow.
   4. Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
2. Narrative-first encounters where the mechanics of resolution play a supporting role.
3. Uniformity of gameplay in all scope "zoom levels".
4. No reliance on a strict turn or round structure to drive the tempo of the investigation or escalate the game.
5. Systemic flexibility for the scenario to control the tempo and pressures.
6. Limited opportunities for there to be a long interval between a player taking one meaningful action and them taking their next.
7. Replayability through scenarios that define the outline of an investigation while being able to leave many of the details to chance.
8. Manages game "weight" by keeping each individual action focused and simple to resolve.
9. The game comes with summaries of iconography, game structure, and common actions in sufficient quantity for all players.

23. Extension of RES-05 Die Icons mixing in some ECO-12 Random Production and ACT-17 Events for "Warp and Ward Dice Corruption"

### Setting

Original IP that melds elements primarily from real-world folklore, the Cthulhu Mythos, and the "standard" Dungeons & Dragons cosmology.  The main world is Earthlike with magic-based technology late into their industrial revolution.  There are many other worlds, e.g. fairy, elemental, or shadow, and each world has its own magic.  Native magic is safe while alien magic corrupts.  The only thing that the many alien worlds have in common is that their natives find us tasty.

Art Style

Art style is indicative of origin, with the contemporary main world represented by the subset of Art Nouveau by Alphonse Mucha, especially his lithography, though perhaps reinterpreted in watercolor and ink.  Alien worlds will each be given a distinctive style and medium, for example fairy might be slightly surrealistic oil painting, shadow might be charcoal, and elementals might be mosaics or stained glass.  If an illustration represents things from multiple sources then each of those elements will be rendered in their assigned style.

* A scene showing a fire elemental in a local street would show the street in the typical Art Nouveau while the creature might be stained glass.
* A portrait of a character who has been tainted by shadow might have one body part that is partially, or completely, drawn in (or drawn over with) charcoal.

## Vision

A cooperative narrative-focused board game of investigation and horror with a sliding scope and mechanics that can go from global all the way down to a single hideout.

These elements are all core to the identity of this game.  There is some room for the precise meaning of these, as expanded upon in this section, to be tweaked and tuned, but none of them can be discarded without turning this into some other game.

### A cooperative ...

1. Strictly cooperative.
2. While it's kind of cute from a certain perspective, I especially dislike AH2's "Join the Winning Team" card because it's an opt-in betrayal rather than a game-assigned "betrayal" in a role-based hidden loyalty game, and I also dislike MoM2's changed goals due to insanity.
3. Some players may not want to be forced to play as a "betrayer", so no game effect will ever force this.  For the purposes of this design requirement a "betrayer" would be a character with victory conditions that are different from the group victory conditions.  A subtle example of this is MoM2's Insanity cards where an additional requirement is added for only that player, e.g. "Instead, you win only if [normal victory requirements] and you have 1 or more Spells." because this may force the player to prevent or delay victory until they have met their private requirements (that they are not permitted to talk about) because to them a general failure is "no worse" than failing to meet their special requirements.
4. If for narrative or mechanical reasons a character is ever taken out of player's control, it MUST be stated explicitly what is being forced and the duration of the loss of control, and if it is permanent then from the player perspective it is mechanically equivalent to permanent character death.
5. This does not preclude giving additional restrictions to a character, so long as they are limited to things that would be considered acceptable as "quirks" on a cooperative character at the start of the game, e.g. "you cannot give money to another character ...", and preferably with a cost that can be paid as an alternative to following the new restriction, e.g. "... unless you resolve a Faerie Unforseen Consequences draw with 1 Warp."

### ... narrative-focusted ...

1. As opposed to "mechanically-focused".
2. I would consider PACG to be a "mechanically-focused" game, in that you construct the location encounter decks based on the results of the encounter, which then drive the mechanics of the encounter, and if there's any narrative to that encounter it is something created solely by the players and has no effect on anything in-game.
3. To put it another way, every encounter or deviation from the standard game structure MUST start with the narrative, and the mechanics of the encounter or change to the game structure exist solely to implement the narrative within the framework of the game.

### ... board game ...

1. Resist the urge to veer off into RPG territory.
2. Yes, even for "campaign" or "legacy" play.
3. While it may be good or necessary to have character continuity across multiple plays in such a structure, it should be emphasized that it is not expected that there be a strong player-character link over multiple plays.  The Pandemic Legacy series of games does a good job with this, emphasizing at the beginning that character customization is a group decision and that there will be times when different scenarios call for different mixes of characters.
4. For some reason, Aeon's End Legacy feels like it misses this requirement.  This is perhaps something that should be looked into in more detail.
5. It would be both thematically appropriate and reinforce this part of the vision if the mechanics of gameplay tended to naturally result in some "permanent" (only for campaign or legacy play) character elimination in each session, either through death, voluntary retirement, or other means.
6. Perhaps one way to emphasize this would be to start any "campaign" or "legacy" playthrough by creating more characters than the game supports at one time, or by splitting up the character creation process among multiple players.
   1. E.g. each player starts the process for two characters, then hands them to their left, and then everyone performs the next step for the two characters they were just handed, and so on until all of the characters are complete.  Might want to emphasize that table-talk and group planning are encouraged.

### ... of investigation ...

1. With all due respect to the franchise, neither AH2 nor AH3 really shine in this regard.  I haven't played enough of AHtCG to have an opinion on how well it creates this feeling.
2. On the other hand, this isn't a puzzle game either, meaning that it shouldn't rely on player cleverness to be successful in an "investigation".
3. The goal here is to create the feel of an investigation unfolding rather than turning this into a highly-complex Clue variant or escape room game.
4. The idea at the moment is to have multiple details about the adversary and their plans available for the characters to uncover through encounters.  The only detail necessary for moving on to the next zooming-in of scope is the location, but each additional detail uncovered SHOULD both progress the narrative, give the players a mechanical advantage that's linked to the narrative, and provide information for the players when making choices so that they can tailor their "loadout" for the expected challenge.

### ... and horror ...

1. By horror, I'm talking about narrative horror rather than mechanical horror.
2. To a player being directed to "Lose 1 Sanity" is no more inherently horrifying than "Lose 1 Health", and if the character has a high starting Sanity and low starting Health, it will probably create more tension and trepidation for the player to lose Health than it will be to lose Sanity.
3. Mechanical Sanity tends to end up becoming nothing more than "just another resource" that you manage in your pursuit of victory.  This is especially true when Sanity can be restored, but also tends to be true in other games.  The game DMD makes this explicit because character progression is only possible through permanent Sanity loss.
4. Therefore, there are no mechanics around tracking "sanity" or "horror".
5. Instead, the goal is to create an atmosphere of the unsettling through narration; showing rather than telling.  If the player has to be told that their character is horrified or unsettled then the writer has failed.
6. "Horror" and "Sanity" are used in other media as a way to create tension for the consumer as part of the entertainment.  In this game the goal is to create that tension for the player through irreversible compounding corruption of the body and mind through Warp.
7. None of this rules out game mechanics that affect player agency as a result of corruption of the mind, just as there are mechanics that affect player agency as a result of corruption of the body.  But these should still be  narrative-first, show rather than tell, and not presented to the player as a "horror" or "sanity" system.
8. Further, none of this is saying that it's a bad thing for the player to make choices about when they allow their character to knowingly take actions that will be detrimental to the character's long-term mental health.  These choices are as meaningful, and should be as difficult, as decisions about taking actions that may be detrimental to the character's long-term physical health.  It is simply the case that as a writer and designer these things cannot be considered to be contributing to the texture of "horror" that the game is supposed to convey.

### ... with a sliding scope ...

... and mechanics that can go from global all the way down to a single hideout.

1. This is one of the core premises of the design of this game.
2. Though it may perhaps be best considered to be a theory that is not yet proven.
3. The mechanics described in this document are currently believed to be able to create this vision, and when they are found to be lacking they MUST be either augmented or discarded until they do.
4. One thing that's worth making explicit about this is that it is intended that a single play session will cover three scopes: Global, Regional, and Local.  This implies that many of the setup and teardown steps will have to be performed three times during this one play session.  Therefore, it is vital that these steps be easy to follow, fairly quick to accomplish, and amenable to cooperation among all players to finish more quickly.  It's fine if a group chooses to have one person who handles all of it and everyone else gets a break, but it's not fine if it MUST be that way.  Even someone new to the game should be able to be given discrete tasks that allow them to contribute to both setup and teardown.

## Setting

The first thing that needs to be addressed when talking about the setting is the question of "Why create an original setting rather than using one that already exists?".

There are at least two similar settings that could be freely used.  The first is the Cthulhu Mythos (CM) and the other is the Secret Histories (SH) from the Weather Factory games.  There's also Candela Obscura (CO), which may not be available but is a closer fit than either of the others.

The short answer is that none of them are a good-enough fit.  The longer answer is found in the detail of the characteristics desired in the game and, by extension, the setting.

1. Has a "native" magic that is safe and plentiful, but relatively weak.  This mechanically encourages the players to take risks because things built on the native magic will be underpowered late in the game.
   1. For those familiar with D&D magic, you can think of this as a setting where the "native" magic usually only goes up to second level, and instead of gaining higher-level spell slots magic users would gain even more second level slots (e.g. instead of a fourth level spell slot they gain two second level slots), so a high-level wizard can cast spells like "Scorching Ray" all day long, but it would take a ritual to cast a single "Fireball".
2. Uses a version of "tech" that is based on magic.  I think that the dynamics of having a blurry dichotomy between tech and magic will complicate and distract from some of the other mechanics I want to develop, such as corruption based on "alien" magic.
   1. Iron, and its alloys, will absorb all flavors of magic, so it tends to not be used for things.  The precise mechanics of this are TBD, but it is limited.
   2. Iron ore can be transformed into an ore for "Adamant", a metal that will generally play the role of steel.
   3. Copper ore can be similarly transformed into an ore for "Orichalcum", a metal that is critical in "Thaumostatic" machinery, which generally plays the role of electrical machinery.
   4. Other metallic ores can also be transformed, with the details TBD.
3. Has multiple flavors of "alien" magic.
   1. Each "flavor" of "alien" magic originates from one (or more?) other lands/worlds/realms/planes that connected to the primary world in a way that is more like the world of faerie from folklore than like the planes from D&D (except possibly Sigil from the Planescape setting), though that doesn't necessarily rule out some of them having very different spatial rules.
   2. No effect or (alchemical) element is exclusive to any "flavor" of magic, though most "flavors" are better suited for some effects than others.
   3. As an example, "native" magic can produce fire, as can most other "flavors" of magic, but there are worlds that lean very heavily towards fire and it's easier to produce fire using the magic from those worlds.
4. While the beings from the "alien" worlds are incredibly diverse, and only some of them are sentient, the one thing that they all have in common is that they find things from the primary world to be especially tasty.  While there may be limitations in what things each being can feed upon, generally inorganics are least tasty, then plants, animals, and finally people.
   1. Intelligent beings will usually be able to keep their hunger under control when following orders or when necessary to accomplish a long-term goal.  This includes the more intelligent non-sentient beings as well as most sentient beings.
5. When something from the primary world is exposed to "alien" magics there is a chance that it will absorb some of that essence and become corrupted.  This corruption can grow and eventually dominate that being so that they behave more like something from that "alien" realm than something from the primary world.  This is called "Warp".
6. It is possible to contain and/or protect against the corrupting influence of "alien" magics, though usually only one specific "flavor".  This is called "Ward".
