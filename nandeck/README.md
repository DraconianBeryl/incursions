# Components to be built with nanDECK

## Cards

### Locations

The location itself - its description and mechanics.

### Clue Trail

Symbols that match those assigned to locations.

### Clue Encounters

Special encounters that progress the Plot, but have details that don't depend on the Plot.

### Encounters

Encounters not directly related to the Plot.

### Equipment

Each category may have subdecks. If there are subdecks then there's a method for chosing an item at random from all of them.

#### Starter Equipment

Contains two classes of things:

1. Personal Possessions
2. General starting gear

#### Common Equipment

Things an ordinary person could easily obtain.

#### Rare Equipment

Things not usually available to the general public, but not too difficult to obtain for those in the know.

#### Exotic Equipment

Things that are generally custom made, and/or not necessarily completely legal for a private citizen.

Very strongly Warded alien magical items could be in this deck - would have to be "completely safe" under normal operation.

#### Dangerous Equipment

Things imbued with alien magics that are less than "completely safe", and maybe even outright hazardous to even be near.

May also include more mundane (or native magic) items that are highly illegal.

#### MacGuffins

Items that may have some basic utility on their own, but also have some significance to the Plot and may gain special abilities as a result of that.

Baseline stats can range from "starter" to "dangerous".
